# Project Constraints

> This file defines the boundaries within which all agents must operate.

---

## Technical Constraints

- Must run entirely in the browser — no backend, no server-side logic
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript only — no frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- No build step required — files served directly (static site)
- No paid third-party dependencies — open-source libraries only if needed

## Budget Constraints

- No paid APIs or services
- Hosting must be free tier (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify free)
- No paid tools — all development tooling must be free or already available

## Time Constraints

- No hard external deadlines
- Sprint cadence: flexible (approximately 1–2 weeks per Sprint)
- Progress driven by quality and collaboration interest, not time pressure

## Scope Constraints

- English-only UI for current version (original Spanish version was replaced, not maintained in parallel)
- No user authentication or accounts
- No backend / database — all computation is client-side
- Two-scenario comparison only (not N-scenario)
- Framework limited to the Efficacy/Efficiency/Effectiveness model from the research paper

## Team Constraints

- Solo developer (Heikel Andres Molina)
- No dedicated QA resource — testing is developer responsibility
- AI workforce (`ai/` folder) assists with planning, analysis, and code review

## Regulatory / Compliance

- No regulatory requirements for MVP
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) is a nice-to-have, not a hard requirement yet

## Design Constraints

- No existing brand guidelines — clean, functional UI is sufficient
- Responsive design desired but not yet implemented
- No design system or component library — CSS is hand-written

## Methodology

- Scrum-inspired with flexible Sprint cadence
- Product Backlog maintained in `ai/context/product-backlog.md`
- AI agents assist with Scrum ceremonies (refinement, review)
- Hybrid approach acceptable when constraints require it
