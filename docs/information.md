POST:
Reward effort or outcomes: How should we measure a team?

Many of us say that we don't care how many hours someone works, just that the work gets done

But often the work can be stalled outside of someone's control

-New high priority projects for your team
-End user responsiveness
-Interdependent teams - other teams either unable to prioritize the work, issues in building it, etc

Measurements are one of my 4 key pillars. So how do you measure a team?

Many of us resort to pseudo measurements 
- Hours logged - but does this mean value?
- Tickets completed / story points completed - define done , and still does this mean value?
- OKRs completed - but what about the outside factors?


How do you measure your teams for success?

Your post resonated with me. Some months ago I worked on a small project based on a framework from operations research (originally used by the U.S. military) that formalizes exactly this problem. It breaks measurement into three layers:

Efficacy — Did we hit the goal? (Achieved vs. Expected results)
Efficiency — Did we hit it without burning disproportionate time and cost?
Effectiveness — A composite score blending both.

The key insight: it's not effort or outcomes — it's both, combined into a single comparable metric. And it uses quantitative ratios scored into qualitative bands, so it's the "mix".

The project is still incomplete and in Spanish, but I'm working on translating it and documenting it properly. I'll share it soon.
Would love to discuss how it maps to software teams. 🚀

Given how much of delivery can be outside the team’s control, what kind of measurement do you find most meaningful: quantitative, qualitative, or a mix?

That is the million dollar question I am trying to figure out. I tend to fall to pseduo-productive metrics that are quantitative - story points, etc, also things like bugs etc. I don't love it, as it isn't the whole story.

Maybe I need to learn about grounded theory kind of work - qualitiative and uses inductive reasoning

and how often is the work outcome literally outside the control of the individual or team? Constantly changing expectations, time constraints, poor communication for leadership, etc... it all impedes good quality work.

Exactly, so how do we measure work? How can we objectively evaluate employees on what matter with these kinds of things?

I forgot to mention this in the OP, but as you know, outcomes leads to outcome bias. How do we measure to overcome this?

Great point. Focusing only on outcomes can unintentionally punish effort, learning and problem-solving. A healthier approach measures ownership, adaptability and progress toward value, even when external constraints slow things down.

Tyler Mann

Kofi Asempa Osei-Tutu, D.Sc. agreed, so how do you actually measure that?

I really think this is a valuable dialogue. I'm interested to hear what people think. 


Or I'll sit alone in the dark pondering 🤔
