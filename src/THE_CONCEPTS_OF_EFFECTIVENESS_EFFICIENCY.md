## 1. Introduction: The Challenge of Measuring Performance

One of the challenges of modern management is **performance measurement**: how to determine which organizational units contribute best to results, when there is such a diversity of responsibility centers with varied functions, tasks, and responsibilities?

Organizational structures contain very diverse units:

- **Profit centers** for managing products and customers.
- **Divisions by market segment** or by territory.
- **Internal areas** such as production, administration, planning, control, marketing, finance, etc.

All serve the same corporate purpose, but in practice each has very different tasks, making it difficult to measure their performance uniformly. A **system of comparable indicators** is needed to analyze competitiveness and efficiency across different organizational units.

Traditional evaluation models were designed for profit areas (product management, customer service, revenue generation), but often there are no good tools available for the other areas of the company.

From this need arose the indicators of **effectiveness and efficacy**, originally derived from the result measurement procedures used by the United States Army, and subsequently used successfully in various economic activities.

## 2. Key Definitions

### 2.1 Efficacy

> The degree to which the objectives and goals of a plan are achieved, that is, **how much of the expected results were attained**.

It consists of concentrating efforts on the activities and processes that truly need to be carried out to fulfill the stated objectives.

### 2.2 Efficiency

> Achievement of an objective at the **lowest possible unit cost**.

The aim is optimal use of available resources to achieve the desired objectives.

### 2.3 Effectiveness

> Encompasses both efficiency and efficacy: the achievement of planned results **on time and at the most reasonable costs possible**.

It means doing the right thing with great precision and without any waste of time or money.

## 3. Universal Applicability

These indicators can be used for **all types of organizational areas**, regardless of whether their tasks are commercial, intellectual, production-related, control-related, etc.

In any area it is always possible to define:

- An **expected result** (goal, quantity, variation, percentage, etc.)
- An **estimated cost**
- A **specified time**

The combination of these three elements — result, cost, and time — allows for the objective measurement of the degree of effectiveness and efficacy, and enables comparisons even between dissimilar areas.

## 4. Calculation Formulas

### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning             |
|--------|---------------------|
| **R**  | Result              |
| **E**  | Expected            |
| **A**  | Achieved            |
| **C**  | Cost                |
| **T**  | Time                |

### Main Formulas

| Indicator         | Formula                                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Efficacy**      | `RA / RE`                                             |
| **Efficiency**    | `(RA / (CA × TA)) / (RE / (CE × TE))`                |
| **Effectiveness** | `(Efficiency Score + Efficacy Score) / 2`             |

> **Effectiveness** is expressed as a percentage (%) and its maximum score is obtained by averaging the efficiency and efficacy scores.

## 5. Rating Tables

### 5.1 Efficacy

| Points | Fulfillment Range   |
|--------|---------------------|
| 0      | 0 – 20%             |
| 1      | 21 – 40%            |
| 2      | 41 – 60%            |
| 3      | 61 – 80%            |
| 4      | 81 – 90%            |
| 5      | > 91%               |

### 5.2 Efficiency

| Points | Rating           | Condition          |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| 1      | Inefficient      | Quotient < 1       |
| 3      | Efficient        | Quotient = 1       |
| 5      | Very efficient   | Quotient > 1       |

## 6. Interpretation of the Indicators

### Efficacy

Efficacy is simply the comparison between what was achieved and what was expected (`RA / RE`). The higher levels correspond to very high execution percentages, whose rating becomes increasingly difficult to obtain. Achieving a 5 is not simply performing a task four degrees better than a 1: **the higher levels of fulfillment demand greater efforts and impose greater degrees of difficulty**.

### Efficiency

The quotient compares `RA / (CA × TA)` against `RE / (CE × TE)`, that is, what was achieved versus what was expected, incorporating two critical variables: **cost incurred** and **time spent**.

- The relationship of cost and time to the result is **inverse**: the less time or money consumed, the better the performance.
- The more result obtained per unit of time and cost, the more favorable the situation.
- The efficiency formula combines the efficacy variables (`RA / RE`) weighted by the time and cost factors in an inverse manner. That is, **high efficiency presupposes high efficacy**.

### Effectiveness

> **Whoever is efficient and efficacious is effective.** This is what we all desire for our companies.

## 7. Benefits of Applying These Indicators

1. **Goal setting:** All areas will need to define goals, which drives objective setting, prioritization, resource allocation, capacity measurement, and integration of efforts.

2. **Cost and time awareness:** Each area must become familiar with estimates of the time and costs of its operations, rationalizing the use of resources.

3. **Comparative evaluation:** It is possible to establish these indicators as part of performance measurement for each area, and even compare indicators and their causes (results, cost, and time) across areas with different vocations.

4. **Incentive plans:** They can be used as a foundational element for financial incentive plans.

5. **Continuous improvement:** The discipline of setting effectiveness and efficacy goals produces a **continuous elevation of the company's competitiveness**.

## 8. Reference

The experience of the United States Armed Forces in the use of this type of indicator is proof of its timeliness, consistency, and suitability.
